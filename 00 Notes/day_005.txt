======================== Day 5 Goals what we will make by the end of the day

 Notes from Day 5 - Password Generator Project

Introduction:
- Congratulations on reaching Day 5 of the 100 Days of Code challenge.
- Today's project is a Password Generator, inspired by the frequent data breaches in companies like Ashley Madison, Verizon, etc.

Why Password Security Matters:
- Many companies struggle to keep passwords safe.
- Common hacking method: Password reuse
  - People use the same password across multiple sites (Google, Facebook, Spotify, etc.).
  - If one site is hacked, your email-password combo can be used to access other sites.

How to Check if You've Been Hacked:
- Visit [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).
- Enter your email to see if your credentials have been compromised.
- Example: Using `elon@tesla.com` shows which websites have leaked data.
- Recommendation: Check your own email to see if your data has been compromised.

Improving Password Security:
- Use unique passwords for every site.
- Avoid weak passwords like `123456` or `qwerty`.
- If your current password matches these examples, change it immediately.

Project Overview - Password Generator:
- Purpose: Generate strong, secure passwords using:
  - Letters (upper and lowercase)
  - Symbols (e.g., `@, , $, %`)
  - Numbers
- How it works:
  - User inputs the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers.
  - The generator outputs a random, strong password based on these criteria.

Example Workflow:
1. How many letters? → `12`
2. How many symbols? → `2`
3. How many numbers? → `2`
4. The program generates a strong password like: `aBcdEfGh12@`

Next Steps:
- Learn new Python concepts and skills needed to build this project.
- Proceed to the next lesson to start coding the Password Generator.


=====================================================
======================== Using the for loop with Python Lists

 For Loop Notes

 The concept of loops
 - Loops allow you to perform tasks repeatedly over and over again.

 For Loop introduction
 - A For loop is used to iterate through each item in a list.

 Example 1: Simple For Loop
 - We have a list of fruits: ["apple", "peach", "pear"]
fruits = ["apple", "peach", "pear"]

 - Using a For loop to print each fruit one by one
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

 Output: 
 apple
 peach
 pear

 Explanation:
 - The For loop takes each item in the fruits list.
 - The variable 'fruit' is assigned the value of each item in the list (apple, peach, pear).
 - Then the print statement prints the value of 'fruit'.

 Behind the scenes:
 - First iteration: fruit = "apple" -> prints "apple"
 - Second iteration: fruit = "peach" -> prints "peach"
 - Third iteration: fruit = "pear" -> prints "pear"

 Debugging in Thonny IDE:
 - You can use the Debug feature to step through each loop iteration and watch the value of the 'fruit' variable change.

 Example 2: Multiple Statements Inside the Loop
 - We can execute multiple actions inside the loop.
 - Let's also print 'fruit + " pie"' for each fruit.
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)           Prints the fruit
    print(fruit + " pie")  Prints fruit + " pie"

 Output:
 apple
 apple pie
 peach
 peach pie
 pear
 pear pie

 Important note on Indentation:
 - Code that is indented is part of the loop and will be executed repeatedly.
 - If you remove the indentation, the code will execute only once, not as part of the loop.

 Example 3: Indentation and Scope
 - Printing the fruits list inside the loop will print the list as many times as there are items.
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)    This is inside the loop, so it prints each fruit.
    print(fruits)   This is inside the loop, so it prints the whole list each time.

 Output:
 apple
 ['apple', 'peach', 'pear']
 peach
 ['apple', 'peach', 'pear']
 pear
 ['apple', 'peach', 'pear']

 Example 4: Printing the fruits list outside the loop
 - If we print the fruits list outside the loop, it will print only once.
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)   Inside the loop, prints each fruit

print(fruits)   Outside the loop, prints the entire list only once

 Output:
 apple
 peach
 pear
 ['apple', 'peach', 'pear']

 Key takeaway:
 - Indentation is crucial to determine what is inside or outside the loop.
 - Only indented code runs repeatedly, anything outside the loop runs once after the loop ends.

 Conclusion:
 - For loops are helpful for repeating tasks multiple times for each item in a list.
 - Use loops to automate repetitive actions and save time.
 - Be mindful of indentation to ensure the loop behaves as expected.

 Practice:
 - Try modifying the examples to better understand how loops work and experiment with different types of data.

=====================================================
======================== [Interactive Coding Exercise] Average Height

 Exercise: Calculate Average Height of Students

 The task is to calculate the average height of students using a for loop.

 Step 1: Input Data
 - The input contains the list of student heights in centimeters.
 - We are provided with the heights, and the list is already converted.

 Step 2: Goal of Exercise
 - The primary goal is to use a for loop to calculate total height and the number of students.
 - We should not use the built-in Python methods like len() or sum() for this exercise.

 Step 3: Plan
 - We need to replicate the behavior of `len()` and `sum()` using a for loop.
 - Calculate the total height and number of students using a for loop, then compute the average.

 Step 4: Total Height Calculation
 - Initialize a variable `total_height` to 0.
 - Use a for loop to iterate through each height in the `student_heights` list.
 - Accumulate the total height by adding each student's height to the `total_height` variable.
 - Use the `+=` operator to add the value to `total_height`.

 Example:
 student_heights = [160, 170, 180, 190]
 total_height = 0
 for height in student_heights:
     total_height += height
 print(f"total_height = {total_height}")

 Step 5: Number of Students Calculation
 - Initialize a variable `number_of_students` to 0.
 - Use another for loop to iterate through each student in `student_heights` and add 1 for each student.
 - This replicates the behavior of `len()`, counting the number of elements in the list.

 Example:
 number_of_students = 0
 for height in student_heights:
     number_of_students += 1
 print(f"number_of_students = {number_of_students}")

 Step 6: Calculate Average Height
 - Once we have the `total_height` and `number_of_students`, divide the `total_height` by `number_of_students` to calculate the average.
 - Use the `round()` function to round the average height to a whole number.

 Example:
 average_height = total_height / number_of_students
 rounded_average = round(average_height)
 print(f"average height = {rounded_average}")

 Step 7: Final Output
 - The program should print:
   - total height
   - number of students
   - average height

 Step 8: Summary
 - This exercise is about practicing for loops to calculate total height and number of students manually.
 - We did not use built-in methods like `len()` or `sum()`.
 - The final output includes the total height, number of students, and the average height.

 Additional Notes:
 - Practicing loops will help in understanding how to work with lists without relying on shortcuts.
 - The task replicates some core functionalities (like len() and sum()) to enhance loop understanding.

=====================================================
======================== [Interactive Coding Exercise] High Score

 Exercise: Find the Highest Score in a List of Scores

 Task: Write a program to find the highest score from a list of student scores.

 Key Points:
 - The goal is to replicate the functionality of the Python max() function using a for loop.
 - Do not use the max() function for this task. Instead, use a for loop to track the highest score.

 Step 1: Input Data
 - The input consists of a list of student scores.
 - Lines 2-4 are already written for you to grab the scores from input and store them in a list called `scores`.

 Step 2: Initialize Highest Score
 - Create a variable called `highest_score` and set it to 0. 
 - This will be used to keep track of the highest score as we loop through the list.

 Step 3: Write a For Loop
 - We need to loop through each score in the `scores` list.
 - Inside the loop, we check if the current score is greater than the current `highest_score`.

 Example:
 scores = [85, 92, 78, 99, 90]
 highest_score = 0
 for score in scores:
     if score > highest_score:
         highest_score = score

 Step 4: Condition inside the Loop
 - Inside the for loop, use an `if` statement to check if the current score is greater than `highest_score`.
 - The first time the loop runs, `highest_score` is 0, so the first score will always be greater than 0 unless there is a negative score.
 - Each time we loop through, we check if the current score is greater than `highest_score`, and if true, we update `highest_score`.

 Step 5: Final Output
 - Once the loop has checked all the scores, we use a print statement to display the highest score.
 - The print statement should be outside the for loop, ensuring that it only runs once all scores have been checked.

 Example:
 print(f"The highest score in the class is: {highest_score}")

 Step 6: Summary
 - The loop ensures that we track and update the highest score as we go through each score in the list.
 - The `if` statement ensures that only the highest score is stored in the `highest_score` variable.
 - Finally, print the highest score once all scores have been processed.

 Notes:
 - This exercise helps practice using for loops and conditionals (`if` statements).
 - It is essential to understand how to manually replicate the functionality of Python built-in functions like max().

=====================================================
======================== for loops and the range() function

 Notes: Using For Loops with the Range Function

 Key Concept: For loops can be used independently of lists. You can generate a range of numbers and loop through it.

 Example: Gauss Problem (Summing Numbers from 1 to 100)
 - Carl Gauss, as a child, was given an exercise to add all numbers from 1 to 100.
 - He cleverly realized that reversing the numbers (100 + 1, 99 + 2, etc.) created pairs that summed to 101.
 - With 50 pairs, the total is 50  101 = 5050.
 - We can replicate this sum with a simple Python program using a for loop and the range() function.

 Step 1: Using the Range Function
 - The range() function is used to generate a range of numbers to loop through.
 - Syntax: range(start, stop)
 - Example: range(1, 10) generates numbers from 1 to 9 (inclusive of 1, exclusive of 10).

 Step 2: Basic Loop with Range
 - For example, the following loop prints numbers from 1 to 9:
   for number in range(1, 10):
       print(number)
 - The range excludes the last number in the sequence. So `range(1, 10)` will print numbers 1 through 9.

 Step 3: Adjusting the Range
 - If you want the loop to include 10, adjust the range to `range(1, 11)`.

 Step 4: Custom Step Size
 - By default, the range function steps by 1, but you can change the step size.
 - Syntax: range(start, stop, step)
 - Example: range(1, 10, 3) will generate numbers starting from 1 and stepping by 3: 1, 4, 7.

 Step 5: Solving Gauss's Problem with Code
 - We can add up all the numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop and the range function:
   total = 0
   for number in range(1, 101):
       total += number
 - This loop adds each number from 1 to 100 to the `total` variable.

 Step 6: Output the Sum
 - Once the loop finishes, we can print the total sum to verify that it matches Gauss's result:
   print(total)   Output: 5050

 Summary:
 - The range function is powerful for creating loops that are not tied to lists.
 - You can customize the range to include specific numbers and set a step size.
 - In this case, the range function allows us to easily sum numbers from 1 to 100, replicating Gauss's method.

 Challenge:
 - Practice using the range function to solve similar problems and try completing the next challenge.

======================== [Interactive Coding Exercise] Adding Even Numbers

 Notes on the exercise to calculate the sum of even numbers from 1 to a target number

 Step 1: Initialize an accumulator variable to store the sum of even numbers
even_sum = 0   This variable will accumulate the sum of even numbers

 Step 2: Use a for loop with the range() function to loop through the even numbers
 The range function takes 3 arguments: start, stop, and step
 For this task, we will start at 2 (the first even number), 
 set the stop at target + 1 (to include the target number),
 and use a step of 2 to get only even numbers

 First Method: Using range with step of 2
target = int(input("Enter a number: "))   Take user input for target number
for number in range(2, target + 1, 2):     Loop through even numbers from 2 to target
    even_sum += number                    Add each even number to the accumulator

 After the loop finishes, print the sum of all even numbers
print(even_sum)   Output the sum of even numbers

 Alternative Method: Using range and checking for even numbers with modulo (%)

 Second Method: Check if the number is even using modulo operator
alternative_sum = 0   Another accumulator for the second method

 Loop through all numbers from 1 to the target number
for number in range(1, target + 1):   Range from 1 to target
    if number % 2 == 0:   If the number is divisible by 2 (even number)
        alternative_sum += number   Add the even number to the alternative accumulator

 After the loop finishes, print the sum of even numbers
print(alternative_sum)   Output the alternative sum

 Key Concepts:
 1. range(start, stop, step): A function that generates a sequence of numbers
 2. The modulo operator (%) checks if a number is divisible by 2 (even number)
 3. An accumulator is used to hold the running total (sum)
 4. Avoid large inputs (more than 1000) to prevent long execution times

=====================================================
======================== [Interactive Coding Exercise] The FizzBuzz Job Interview Question

 Notes on the FizzBuzz coding exercise

 Goal: Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 100, 
 with replacements for numbers divisible by 3, 5, or both:
  - "Fizz" for multiples of 3
  - "Buzz" for multiples of 5
  - "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5

 Step 1: Set the target (100)
target = 100   The target number up to which we will print

 Step 2: Create a range using range() function
 range(start, stop) generates numbers from 'start' to 'stop-1'
 So to include 100, we need to set stop as target + 1
for number in range(1, target + 1):   Loop through numbers from 1 to 100

     Step 3: Check divisibility for 3 and 5
    if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")   Print FizzBuzz for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5

     Step 4: Check divisibility for 3 only
    elif number % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")   Print Fizz for numbers divisible by 3

     Step 5: Check divisibility for 5 only
    elif number % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")   Print Buzz for numbers divisible by 5

     Step 6: Print the number if it's not divisible by 3 or 5
    else:
        print(number)   Print the number itself if not divisible by 3 or 5

 Key Points:
 1. Using range(1, target + 1) to loop through numbers from 1 to 100.
 2. Divisibility check using modulo (%).
 3. Prioritize checking for divisibility by both 3 and 5 before checking for individual conditions.
 4. Use 'if', 'elif', and 'else' statements to handle different conditions.
 5. Print each result on a new line.

 This is a common coding interview question, so practicing FizzBuzz is helpful.

======================== Day 5 Project Create a Password Generator


 Notes on PyPassword Generator Project

 Introduction:
- We're building a password generator that asks the user for:
  - Number of letters
  - Number of symbols
  - Number of numbers
- The program generates a password based on those inputs, and it should be difficult to crack.

 Initial Setup:
- Go to the provided Repl.it (`password-generator-start`), which includes:
  - A list of letters (uppercase and lowercase A-Z).
  - A list of numbers.
  - A list of symbols commonly used in passwords.
  - Inputs asking for the number of letters, symbols, and numbers.

 Project Objective:
- Goal: Generate a random password based on user input.
- Two levels of difficulty:
  1. Easy Level: Password is generated in sequence (letters first, symbols second, numbers last).
  2. Hard Level: Password is generated with random order (letters, symbols, and numbers are mixed randomly).

 Easy Level:
- Approach:
  - Use `random.choice()` to pick random items from lists (letters, symbols, and numbers).
  - Use a `for loop` to add the required number of each item to the password.
  - Example: For 4 letters, 2 symbols, and 2 numbers, the password is generated by first picking 4 letters, then 2 symbols, then 2 numbers.
  - Print the final password once the required number of characters are added.

- Code Walkthrough:
  1. Generating random letters:
     ```python
     import random
     password = ""
     letters = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", ...]
     for char in range(4):   4 letters
         random_char = random.choice(letters)
         password += random_char
     print(password)
     ```
  2. Concatenating characters: Use `password += random_char` to add each random character to the password.
  
- Final Password: Once the password has the required letters, symbols, and numbers, print the password.

 Issue with Predictable Passwords:
- Problem: If symbols and numbers are always placed in the same order, a hacker could predict the pattern and crack the password more easily.
- Solution: Hard Level randomizes the order of the characters.

 Hard Level:
- Approach:
  1. Instead of concatenating to a string, use a list to store characters.
  2. After adding all the letters, symbols, and numbers to the list, shuffle the list using `random.shuffle()`.
  3. Convert the list back into a string for the final password.

- Code Walkthrough:
  1. Creating password list:
     ```python
     password_list = []
      Adding random letters
     for _ in range(4):
         password_list.append(random.choice(letters))
      Adding random symbols
     for _ in range(2):
         password_list.append(random.choice(symbols))
      Adding random numbers
     for _ in range(2):
         password_list.append(random.choice(numbers))
     ```
  2. Shuffling the list:
     ```python
     random.shuffle(password_list)
     ```
  3. Converting list to string:
     ```python
     password = "".join(password_list)
     print(f"Your password is {password}")
     ```

- Example Output: With 12 letters, 3 symbols, and 4 numbers, the password will appear random after the shuffle.

 Final Steps:
- After implementing the easy version, try the hard version for a more complex solution.
- Use Google to research anything you might need, like how to shuffle lists in Python.

 Summary:
- Easy Level: Generate the password in sequence (letters first, then symbols, then numbers).
- Hard Level: Randomize the order of letters, symbols, and numbers by adding them to a list and shuffling it before converting it back into a string.
