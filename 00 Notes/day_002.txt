=====================================================
======================== Python Primitive Data Types

Data Types Overview:

1. String:
   - A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
   - Example: "hello", "world".
   - Each character in a string has a specific position or index.
     - Index starts at 0.
   - Example:
     print("hello"[0])  # Output: 'h'
   - You can extract characters by specifying the index inside square brackets [].

2. Integer:
   - An integer is a whole number, no decimal places.
   - Example: 123, -456.
   - Integer arithmetic can be performed (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.).
   - Example:
     print(123 + 345)  # Output: 468

3. Float:
   - A float is a number with decimal points.
   - Example: 3.14, -0.99.
   - The decimal point "floats" around the number.
   - Example:
     pi = 3.14159  # This is a float

4. Boolean:
   - A boolean can have one of two values: True or False.
   - Example:
     is_raining = True
     is_sunny = False

---

Important Operations:

1. String Operations:
   - Concatenation: Combine strings using +.
     Example:
       print("Hello" + " " + "World!")  # Output: "Hello World!"
   - Multiplication: Repeat a string using *.
     Example:
       print("Hi! " * 3)  # Output: "Hi! Hi! Hi!"

2. Arithmetic Operations (for integers and floats):
   - Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/)
     Example:
       print(10 + 5)  # Output: 15
       print(10 - 5)  # Output: 5
       print(10 * 5)  # Output: 50
       print(10 / 5)  # Output: 2.0
       

Operations on Strings:
1. Len function: Returns the length of a string.
   Example:
     print(len("hello"))  # Output: 5

2. Type Conversion:
   - You can convert between different data types (e.g., from string to integer).
   - int(): Converts a string or float to an integer.
   - float(): Converts a string or integer to a float.
   - str(): Converts a number or boolean to a string.

   Example:
     print(int("123") + 10)  # Output: 133
     print(str(123) + " dollars")  # Output: "123 dollars"
   
3. Type Error:
   - Type errors occur when trying to perform an operation on incompatible types.
   Example:
     print("123" + 345)  # This will result in a TypeError because "123" is a string and 345 is an integer.

=====================================================
======================== Type Error, Type Checking and Type Conversion

Functions Overview:

1. What are functions?
   - Functions are like machines in a factory.
   - Imagine a machine that turns potatoes into chips.
     - The machine might peel, wash, cut, fry, and return the chips to you.
   - Similarly, functions take inputs (potatoes), process them, and return outputs (chips).
   - You don't need to know how the machine works, just that it produces a result.

2. What happens if the wrong input is passed to the function?
   - If you try to pass an incompatible input (like a rock instead of potatoes), the machine will break. 
   - Similarly, when you pass the wrong data type to a function, you get an error (like the TypeError).
   - Example: The `len()` function works with strings, not integers.

---

Understanding Type Errors:

1. Example with `len()` function:
   - The `len()` function expects a string, but passing an integer causes a TypeError.
     Example:
       name = input("What is your name? ")
       num_char = len(name)
       print("Your name has " + num_char + " characters.")
   - This will break because `num_char` is an integer and you're trying to concatenate it with a string.

2. Why does it break?
   - You can't concatenate a string with an integer directly. This causes a TypeError.
   - Solution: Convert `num_char` into a string using type conversion.

---

Using the `type()` Function:

1. What does `type()` do?
   - The `type()` function tells you what type of data you're working with.
   - Example:
     print(type(123))  # Output: <class 'int'>
     print(type("Hello"))  # Output: <class 'str'>

2. Check the data type of variables:
   - If you're not sure about the data type, use `type()` to find out.

---

Type Conversion (Casting):

1. What is type conversion?
   - Type conversion (or type casting) is changing a data type to another.
   - Example:
     - Convert an integer to a string using the `str()` function.
     - Convert a string to an integer using the `int()` function.
     - Convert an integer to a float using the `float()` function.

2. Example of type conversion:
   - You can convert an integer (`num_char`) to a string to avoid breaking the code.
   - Code:
     ```python
     num_char = 6
     new_num_char = str(num_char)
     print("Your name has " + new_num_char + " characters.")  # Output: Your name has 6 characters.
     ```
   - This works because the data type of `new_num_char` is now a string, and you can safely concatenate it with other strings.

---

Converting Between Different Data Types:

1. Convert an integer to a string:
   - Example:
     ```python
     a = 123
     print(type(a))  # Output: <class 'int'>
     a = str(a)
     print(type(a))  # Output: <class 'str'>
     ```

2. Convert an integer to a float:
   - Example:
     ```python
     a = 123
     print(type(a))  # Output: <class 'int'>
     a = float(a)
     print(type(a))  # Output: <class 'float'>
     ```

---

Examples with Type Conversion:

1. Integer to String:
   - You can convert integers to strings to avoid concatenation errors.
   - Example:
     ```python
     num = 100
     print(str(num) + " is a number.")  # Output: "100 is a number."
     ```

2. String to Float:
   - You can also convert strings to floats for mathematical operations.
   - Example:
     ```python
     number_str = "100.5"
     result = float(number_str) + 70
     print(result)  # Output: 170.5
     ```

3. String Concatenation:
   - If you add a string to another string, you'll get concatenation.
   - Example:
     ```python
     str1 = "70"
     str2 = "100"
     print(str1 + str2)  # Output: 70100
     ```

---

In Summary:

1. Use `type()` to check the data type of a variable.
2. Use `str()`, `int()`, or `float()` to convert between data types.
3. Type conversion prevents errors when combining different data types (e.g., strings with numbers).
4. Be mindful of the data types you're working with to avoid TypeErrors.

======================== [Interactive Coding Exercise] Data Types

Exercise: Add the digits in a two-digit number

Goal:
- Write a program to add the digits in a two-digit number (e.g., 39 -> 3 + 9 = 12).

Steps to solve:

1. Get the first and second digits:
   - Input comes as a string, so use the `input()` function to capture the number.
   - Use indexing to get individual digits from the string:
     - `two_digit_number[0]` gives the first digit as a string.
     - `two_digit_number[1]` gives the second digit as a string.

2. Convert string to integer:
   - To perform mathematical operations, convert the string to an integer using `int()`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     first_digit = int(two_digit_number[0])
     second_digit = int(two_digit_number[1])
     ```

3. Add the digits:
   - Add the two integer digits.
   - Example:
     ```python
     result = first_digit + second_digit
     ```

4. Print the result:
   - Use `print()` to output the result.
   - Example:
     ```python
     print(result)
     ```

Best Practices:
- Code readability is important:
  - Always prioritize readability over minimizing the number of lines.
  - Someone else should be able to understand your code easily.
  - Avoid "Code Golf" (writing the least number of lines). Focus on clear, understandable code.

Summary:
- Use `input()` to get the number as a string.
- Use indexing and `int()` to extract and convert digits.
- Add the digits and print the result.
- Write readable code, not just concise code.

=====================================================
======================== Mathematical Operations in Python

Mathematical Operations in Python:

1. Addition (+):
   - Adds two numbers.
   - Can also be used to concatenate strings.

2. Subtraction (-):
   - Subtracts one number from another.
   - Example: `7 - 3` gives `4`.

3. Multiplication (*):
   - Uses the asterisk `*` for multiplication (not `x`).
   - Example: `3 * 2` gives `6`.

4. Division (/)
   - Uses the forward-slash `/` for division.
   - Result is always a float, even if the division is exact.
   - Example: `6 / 3` gives `2.0`.

5. Exponentiation (**)
   - Use `` for exponents (raising a number to a power).
   - Example: `2 ** 3` gives `8`.

   - Python’s built-in exponentiation is highly appreciated by data scientists and mathematicians.

6. PEMDAS Rule (Order of operations):
   - Parentheses
   - Exponents
   - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
   - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
   - Multiplication and Division are equally prioritized, and the order is left to right.
   - Addition and Subtraction have the lowest priority.

7. Example Calculation:
   - For the equation `3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3`:
     - Multiplication and Division happen first (from left to right).
     - Step-by-step: 
       - `3 * 3` = `9`
       - `3 / 3` = `1`
       - `9 + 1` = `10`
       - `10 - 3` = `7`
     - Result = `7.0`.

8. Changing Calculation Order:
   - To change the result, use parentheses to adjust the priority of operations.
   - For example, adding parentheses around `3 + 3` in `3 * (3 + 3) / 3 - 3` changes the result:
     - First calculate `3 + 3` = `6`
     - Then `3 * 6` = `18`
     - Then `18 / 3` = `6`
     - Finally `6 - 3` = `3`.

9. Challenge:
   - The parentheses allow us to prioritize operations in a specific order and change the outcome of the calculations.

Key Takeaways:
- Python supports basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
- The order of operations (PEMDAS) is important to remember.
- Use parentheses to control the priority of operations and ensure the calculation occurs as intended.

Next Step:
- Try out a new challenge in the following lesson to test your understanding of these concepts.

=====================================================
======================== [Interactive Coding Exercise] BMI Calculator

Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculation - Notes

1. What is BMI?
   - BMI is a measure of weight in relation to height.
   - It helps to assess if someone is overweight, underweight, or in a healthy weight range.
   - Formula: 
     BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)^2
   - The formula uses weight in kilograms and height in meters.
   - Important: Inputs should be in metric units (kg and meters).

2. Steps to Calculate BMI in Python:
   - Convert the weight and height inputs into the appropriate data types.
     - Weight: Convert the weight to an integer.
     - Height: Convert the height to a float since height is typically represented with decimal values (e.g., 1.79 meters).
   
3. Mathematical Operations in Python:
   - Squaring the Height: 
     - Use the exponent operator ** to square the height: height_as_float ** 2.
     - Alternatively, use parentheses to square the height: (height * height).

4. Calculating BMI:
   - BMI = weight / (height * height)
   - Print the BMI result as a whole number (integer).

5. Important Notes:
   - Ensure correct data types for weight and height.
   - Make sure the BMI result is an integer by rounding if necessary.
   - Ensure correct order of operations when performing calculations (use parentheses when needed).
   - Test the program to verify the output.

=====================================================
======================== Number Manipulation and F Strings in Python

Notes on Number Manipulation in Python

Rounding Numbers:
- Round Function:
  - The `round()` function rounds a number to the nearest integer or specified number of decimal places.
  - Example: `round(8 / 3)` gives `3` (rounds 2.666 to the nearest whole number).
  - Example for decimals: `round(8 / 3, 2)` gives `2.67` (rounds to 2 decimal places).

Floor Division:
- Floor Division (`//`):
  - When dividing numbers, the floor division operator `//` returns an integer by discarding the decimal part.
  - Example: `8 // 3` gives `2` (integer result).
  - Example with clean division: `4 // 2` gives `2`.

- Difference between Normal Division `/` and Floor Division `//`:
  - Normal division: `4 / 2` gives `2.0` (floating point).
  - Floor division: `4 // 2` gives `2` (integer).

Shorthand Operators:
- Incrementing and Decrementing Values:
  - Use `+=` to increase a variable’s value.
    - Example: `score = 0; score += 1` makes `score` become `1`.
  - Use `-=` to decrease a variable’s value.
    - Example: `score -= 1` makes `score` become `0`.
  
- Multiplication and Division Shortcuts:
  - Use `*=`, `/=`, and other shorthand operators to modify values.
    - Example: `score *= 2` multiplies `score` by 2.

F-Strings:
- Mixing Strings and Other Data Types:
  - F-strings simplify combining different data types into a string without converting each type manually.
  - Example: `f"Your score is {score}, height is {height}, winning: {isWinning}"`
  - Output: `"Your score is 0, height is 1.8, winning: True"`

=====================================================
======================== [Interactive Coding Exercise] Life in Weeks

Notes on Program to Calculate Weeks Left in Lifetime

Goal:
- Create a program that calculates the number of weeks left in someone's life, based on their age.
- Format the output as: "You have X weeks left." where X is the calculated number of weeks.

Steps:

1. **Input:**
   - The input is the person's age, which comes in as a string.
   - We need to convert this string into an integer to perform calculations.
     - Use the `int()` function to convert the age to an integer.
     - Example: `age = int(input("Enter your age: "))`

2. **Calculating the Years Left:**
   - Subtract the person's age from 90 (assuming a lifespan of 90 years).
   - Formula: `years_left = 90 - age`
   - Example: If the person is 41 years old, then `years_left = 90 - 41 = 49`.

3. **Convert Years Left to Weeks:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year, so multiply the number of years left by 52 to get the total number of weeks.
   - Formula: `weeks_left = years_left * 52`
   - Example: If someone has 49 years left, then `weeks_left = 49 * 52 = 2,548 weeks`.

4. **Output:**
   - Use an f-string to output the result in the required format.
   - Example: `print(f"You have {weeks_left} weeks left.")`
   - This will display the message: "You have 2,548 weeks left."

Example Code:
   age = int(input("Enter your age: ")) 
    Input as string, convert to int years_left = 90 - age
    Calculate years left weeks_left = years_left * 52
    Convert years to weeks print(f"You have {weeks_left} weeks left.") # Output the result


Key Concepts:
- Converting data types (`int()` to convert age string to integer).
- Arithmetic operations (subtraction for years, multiplication for weeks).
- Using f-strings to format output in Python.

=====================================================
======================== Day 2 Project Tip Calculator

Tip Calculator Project Notes

1. Overview of the Tip Calculator
   - The program will calculate the total amount each person should pay after adding a tip to a bill and dividing it among a group.
   - Inputs:
     - Total bill amount (float or int)
     - Tip percentage (int)
     - Number of people (int)
   - Outputs:
     - Each person’s share (rounded to 2 decimal places)

2. Program Breakdown
   - Step 1: Display a welcome message.
     print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
   - Step 2: Ask for the total bill.
     bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
   - Step 3: Ask for the tip percentage.
     tip = int(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? "))
   - Step 4: Ask for the number of people to split the bill.
     people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))

3. Tip Calculation
   - Formula for calculating the tip:
     tip_amount = bill * (tip / 100)
   - Add the tip to the original bill:
     bill_with_tip = bill + tip_amount
   - An alternative shorthand:
     bill_with_tip = bill * (1 + tip / 100)

4. Dividing the Bill
   - After the tip is added, divide the total by the number of people:
     bill_per_person = bill_with_tip / people

5. Rounding the Amount
   - Round the amount to 2 decimal places:
     final_amount = round(bill_per_person, 2)

6. Output the Final Result
   - Display the final amount each person has to pay.
     print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_amount}")

7. Sample Flow
   - "Welcome to the tip calculator!"
   - Input prompts:
     - "What was the total bill?"
     - "How much tip would you like to give?"
     - "How many people to split the bill?"
   - Final output:
     - "Each person should pay: $XX.XX"

8. Example Calculation
   - Bill: $100
   - Tip: 15%
   - People: 5
   - Total bill with tip: $100 * (1 + 0.15) = 115
   - Bill per person: $115 / 5 = 23.00

9. Python Specifics
   - Data Types:
     - input() returns a string, so convert to float() or int().
     - Use round() to limit decimals in the final result.
   - Formatting:
     - Use F-strings for easy embedding of variables in strings:
       print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_amount}")

10. Final Code Example
    print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")

    bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
    tip = int(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? "))
    people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))

    bill_with_tip = bill * (1 + tip / 100)
    bill_per_person = bill_with_tip / people

    final_amount = round(bill_per_person, 2)

    print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_amount}")
