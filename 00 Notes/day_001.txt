   - After writing code, hit "Run" to execute it and see results in the output area.

6. Changing Themes:
   - A darker theme may be easier on your eyes, especially when coding at night.

7. Writing Your First Line of Code:
   - The goal is to tell the computer to do something simple: Print "Hello world!"
   - Use the `print()` function in Python:
     - Type: `print("Hello world!")`
   - This prints "Hello world!" inside the console (output area).

8. Code Explanation:
   - `print()` is a function that displays information to the screen.
   - The content inside the parentheses is a string, i.e., text to be displayed.
   - Strings are enclosed in double quotes (or single quotes).
     - Example: `"Hello world!"` is a string.

9. Common Errors and Debugging:
   - Forgetting a closing quote or parentheses will cause an error.
   - When an error occurs, you may see a hint (e.g., orange color in the code).
   - Look for syntax errors: missing quotes, parentheses, or typos.
   - If you get an error message, search it online (e.g., StackOverflow) for solutions.

10. Fixing Errors:
    - If you forget a quote, the code editor highlights the issue.
    - Use the error message to guide you in finding and fixing the problem.
    - Example: Missing a closing quote → Fix by adding the closing quote.

11. Debugging Tips:
    - Pay attention to syntax highlighting and error messages.

======================== [Interactive Coding Exercise] Printing

Lesson Notes - Python Print Statement

Objective:
- Practice using the print() statement in Python to print text to the Output area.
- Modify the code to print five lines of text, one per line.

Syntax of the print() Statement:
- Basic Format:
  print("text")
  - print: Tells the computer that we want to print something.
  - "text": The text you want to display. This is placed inside double quotes.
  
- Important: Everything inside the double quotes is treated as text, even though it looks like code.

Print Multiple Lines:
- To print multiple lines, we need multiple print() statements.
  Example:
    print("First line")
    print("Second line")
    print("Third line")
    print("Fourth line")
    print("Fifth line")

Important Tips for Output:
- Exact Match: The output must match exactly—pay attention to spaces, punctuation, and case.
- No Extra Spaces or Symbols: Extra spaces can cause errors. Be very careful when copying or typing the text.

Handling Quotes Inside Text:
- Problem: If you want to print text that contains quotes, Python gets confused if the text starts and ends with the same kind of quote.
  Example: print("She said, "Hello!"") will cause an error.

- Solution 1: Alternating Quotes
  - Use single quotes (' ') to define the text and double quotes (" ") inside.
  Example:
    print('She said, "Hello!"')

- Solution 2: Escape Character (\)
  - Use a backslash (\) before the quote inside the text to "escape" it and prevent Python from confusing it with the string delimiter.
  Example:
    print("She said, \"Hello!\"")

Practice Modifying Code:
- Use the knowledge you've learned to modify the code and experiment with different print() statements to see how they behave.

=====================================================
======================== String Manipulation and Code Intelligence

Lesson Notes - Working with Strings in Python

Objective:
- Learn how to create new lines in strings and concatenate strings.
- Understand how to avoid indentation errors and use text editor features for debugging.

1. Printing Multiple Lines Using a Single Print Statement:
   - Previously, to print things on different lines, we had to use multiple `print()` statements.
   - Now, we can print multiple lines using just a single `print()` method by using the `\n` character to create a new line.

   Example:
   print("Hello\nWorld")
   - The `\n` character causes a new line to be created.
   - Shortcut for running code:
     - On Mac: `Command + Enter`
     - On Windows: `Control + Enter`

   - Important Tip: Use a backslash `\` (not a forward slash) for the newline character. Pay attention to syntax highlighting.

2. Concatenating Strings:
   - String concatenation means combining different strings into a single string.
   - Use the `+` operator to join two strings together.

   Example:
   print("Hello" + "Angela")
   - Result: "HelloAngela" (No space between them).

   - To add a space between the strings, you can do the following:
     print("Hello" + " " + "Angela")
     - This adds a space between "Hello" and "Angela".

3. Understanding Indentation Errors:
   - Indentation is critical in Python. It indicates the structure of your code.
   - If you accidentally add spaces or tabs before a line, it can cause an indentation error.
   - Example:
     print("Hello")
     - Make sure there are no unintended spaces before the `print()` statement.

   - Indentation error message: "unexpected indent" is shown when there is extra space or tab in the code.

4. Code Editors and Debugging:
   - Text editors help you avoid errors by highlighting issues and suggesting fixes.
   - Code Intelligence is a feature in many text editors that helps with autocomplete and error detection.
   - Example:
     - If you forget to add double quotes around a string, the editor will show a red squiggly line.
     - You can hover over the squiggly line to see what the error is.

5. Common Errors in Code:
   - Syntax errors happen when there is a mistake in the structure of your code (e.g., missing quotes or parentheses).
   - Indentation errors occur when there's unexpected space or tabs before a line of code.
   - Debugging: If you encounter an error, check for missing characters, spaces, or typos.

6. Debugging Exercise:
   - Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in your code.
   - Common errors include syntax errors and indentation errors.
   - Text editors with code intelligence can help you quickly spot and fix these errors before running your code.

======================== [Interactive Coding Exercise] Debugging Practice

Lesson Notes - Debugging Print Statements in Python

Objective:
- Learn how to debug print statements in Python.
- Understand common syntax and indentation errors.

Steps for Debugging:

1. First Print Statement - Missing Quote:
   - The first issue is a missing double quote before the word "Day."
   - When we use double quotes in Python, it tells the computer which part of the line is the text we want printed.
   - If the quotes are not matched properly, the program won't know which part to print.
   - Fix: Add a double quote before "Day" to properly close the string.

   Example (Incorrect):
   print(Hello Day)

   Example (Fixed):
   print("Hello Day")

2. Second Print Statement - Issue with Double Quotes:
   - The second issue occurs when there is only one set of double quotes around the string.
   - When the program encounters double quotes, it assumes everything between the first and second quote is text to be printed.
   - In this case, the issue is complicated by the `+` symbol in the string.
   - Fix: Alternate the type of quotes used. Change the outer quotes from double to single quotes.

   Example (Incorrect):
   print("This is a " + "String")

   Example (Fixed):
   print('This is a "String"')

3. Third Print Statement - Extra Indentation:
   - Python is very sensitive to indentation. It uses indentation to understand the structure of the code.
   - If there's extra indentation at the beginning of a line, Python will treat it as part of a different code block.
   - Fix: Remove the extra indentation and ensure that the print statement starts at the beginning of the line.

   Example (Incorrect):
      print("Hello World")

   Example (Fixed):
   print("Hello World")

4. Fourth Print Statement - Extra Parenthesis:
   - An extra opening parenthesis is causing an issue in the print statement.
   - Python print statements follow this format: `print("text")`. There should only be one opening and one closing parenthesis.
   - Fix: Remove the extra opening parenthesis.

   Example (Incorrect):
   print(("Hello"))

   Example (Fixed):
   print("Hello")

5. General Debugging Tips:
   - Always ensure that quotes are properly matched (either single or double quotes).
   - Pay attention to indentation—Python treats extra spaces or tabs as separate code blocks.
   - Avoid extra parentheses or unnecessary characters in the print statement.
   - Debugging is part of the learning process, so take your time to understand what each error means and how to fix it.

6. Next Steps:
   - Once you've fixed the errors and the output matches the expected result, you can submit the code.
   - If you get stuck or want more help, remember you can always go through the solution or ask for assistance.

Remember: Debugging is a skill that gets better with practice. Keep working on identifying and fixing issues in your code.

=====================================================
======================== The Python Input Function

# Notes from the lesson on the `input` function in Python

1. Introduction to the `input` function:
   - We use the `input` function to get data from the user.
   - It pauses the program and waits for the user to provide an input.
   - Once the user hits enter, the input data is returned to the program for further use.

2. Syntax of `input`:
   - `input(prompt)` where:
     - `prompt` is a string that will be displayed to the user, asking for input.
     - The program will display this message and wait for the user to type something in.
   
3. How the `input` function works:
   - The program will stop and show the prompt message.
   - The user types their response and hits enter.
   - The program continues once the user provides their input.

4. Example of input usage:
   - `input("What is your name? ")` asks the user for their name.
   - The user's input is saved in the variable `name`.
   - `print("Hello " + name)` prints out a greeting with the user's name.

5. Program flow:
   - After calling the `input` function, the program execution halts until the user enters their response.
   - The input is stored and can be used in subsequent code.

6. Nested functions:
   - You can use the `input` function inside a `print` function to immediately use the data entered by the user.
   - Example:
     ```python
     print("Hello " + input("What is your name? "))
     ```

7. Debugging and Visualization with Thonny:
   - Thonny is a useful Python IDE that helps you visualize code execution step by step.
   - It allows you to step through code, making it easier to understand how input is handled and how code execution progresses.

8. Using Comments:
   - You can comment lines in Python by adding a hashtag (`#`) in front of the text.
   - Comments are ignored by the computer but are helpful for understanding code.
   - To add comments:
     ```python
     # This is a comment
     ```

9. Commenting Keyboard Shortcuts:
   - On Mac, use `command + /` to comment out a line.
   - On Windows, use `control + /` to comment out a line.
   - To undo changes, use `command + z` (Mac) or `control + z` (Windows).

10. Best practices:
   - Write comments above new concepts or complex lines of code to help understand them later.
   - This makes your code easier to comprehend and remember.

11. Recap:
   - In this lesson, we learned how to use the `input` function to take user input.
   - We also learned about nested functions, using comments, and debugging with Thonny.


=====================================================
======================== [Interactive Coding Exercise] Input Function

Input() Function in Auditorium
- Input in Auditorium works differently compared to other environments.
- Input pane appears at the bottom left for exercises requiring input.
- You can replace the example input with your own values.
- Input helps us test your code and make sure it's working properly.

How It Works
- input() function is used to get input from the Input pane.
- After running the code, it picks up inputs line by line.
- For example:
  print(input())
  This will pull in the first line from the Input pane and print it.

Handling Missing Inputs
- If there are more input requests than available lines in the Input pane, you will get an error.
- Example: If you have 4 input() calls but only 3 lines of input, an error will occur.
- The error happens because it’s looking for more inputs than what exists in the pane.

Avoiding Prompts in Input()
- When using input() in Auditorium, avoid adding a prompt (like "What is your name?" inside input()).
- Use just input() so it pulls from the Input pane without showing extra text in the output.

Demo Exercise
- You are asked to use two inputs from the Input pane (e.g., 2 and 3) to perform a multiplication.
- Your code should handle this input dynamically, so it works for all inputs, not just hardcoded values like 2 * 3.
- Hidden tests check edge cases, so you must make your code flexible.

Test Case Example
- The code passes when multiplying 2 * 3, but fails for another test case with inputs 5 and 5 because it prints a fixed output (6).
- You need to adjust your code to handle dynamic inputs.

Using len() Function
- To calculate the length of a string, use len().
  Example:
  len("Hello")  # Output will be 5
- In this case, after taking input from the user, use len() to get the number of characters in the input.

Final Exercise Steps
1. Use input() to get the name from the Input pane.
2. Apply the len() function to the input to calculate the number of letters.
3. Print the length of the name.

=====================================================
======================== Python Variables

Python Variables - Notes

- Introduction to Variables
  - Variables are incredibly useful in programming.
  - They allow us to store data and refer to it later.

- Forking the Starting Code
  - Go to the course resources and fork the Day 1 variables start Repl.it sandbox.
  - This will be the environment where you can work on your own version of the code.

- What Happens Without Variables
  - We are familiar with using `input()` to take user input.
  - The input is received but disappears immediately after it is entered.
  - There's no way to refer to this input again unless we store it.

- What Variables Do
  - Variables let you store data for later use.
  - Example:
    ```python
    name = input("Enter your name: ")
    ```
  - Now, instead of the input disappearing, it's stored in the `name` variable.

- Accessing Data Stored in Variables
  - After storing the input in a variable, you can print or use it later.
  - Example:
    ```python
    print(name)
    ```
  - The value of the variable `name` will be printed, even after the input has been taken.

- Understanding Variables with an Analogy
  - Think of a phone book: You jot down numbers but also associate them with names to know who they belong to.
  - In programming, a variable is like that "name" in the phone book, making it easier to refer to data.

- Changing Variables
  - Variables can be changed throughout the program.
  - Example:
    ```python
    name = "Jack"
    print(name)  # Prints Jack
    name = "Angela"
    print(name)  # Prints Angela
    ```
  - The variable `name` can hold different values at different points in the program.

- Using Variables to Simplify Code
  - Instead of writing long lines of code, variables can store intermediate values.
  - Example:
    ```python
    name = input("Enter your name: ")
    length = len(name)
    print(length)
    ```
  - This makes your code more readable and easier to manage.

- Final Example
  - If we take input for a name and calculate its length:
    ```python
    name = input("Enter your name: ")
    length = len(name)
    print(length)
    ```
  - This approach stores the user input in the `name` variable and the length of the name in the `length` variable.
  - The result is printed after performing the calculations.

- Code Challenge
  - The lesson ends with a challenge for you to apply what you've learned about variables.

=====================================================
======================== [Interactive Coding Exercise] Variables

Exercise - Switching Values in Two Variables

- Goal:
  - The task is to switch the values stored in two variables, `a` and `b`.
  - After inputting values into `a` and `b`, the output should show `a` equal to the value originally in `b`, and `b` equal to the value originally in `a`.

- Steps to Approach:
  1. Initial Setup:
     - Values are inputted into two variables, `a` and `b`.
     - Example: 
       - `a = 29` 
       - `b = 41`
  
  2. Objective:
     - We need to swap the values so that:
       - `a` becomes the value of `b` (41).
       - `b` becomes the value of `a` (29).
  
  3. Think About Variables:
     - Variables hold data temporarily.
     - To swap values, we need to store one value temporarily before switching them.

- Solution (3 lines of code):
  1. Create a Temporary Variable:
     - Create a third variable, `c`, to temporarily store one of the values.
     - Example:
       ```python
       c = a  # Now c = 29
       ```

  2. Assign Value of `b` to `a`:
     - Assign the value of `b` to `a`:
       ```python
       a = b  # Now a = 41
       ```

  3. Assign Value of `c` to `b`:
     - Assign the value of `c` (the original value of `a`) to `b`:
       ```python
       b = c  # Now b = 29
       ```

- Explanation:
  - `c` temporarily holds the value of `a`.
  - Then, the value of `b` is transferred to `a`.
  - Finally, the value in `c` (which holds the original value of `a`) is transferred to `b`.
  - This results in `a` having the value that was in `b`, and `b` having the value that was in `a`.

- Final Output:
  - After executing the above steps, the print statements will show:
    - `a = 41` (which was originally in `b`).
    - `b = 29` (which was originally in `a`).

- Concept to Remember:
  - Temporary Variables: These are crucial when you need to hold a value while performing a swap.
  - Variables are like boxes that store data, and we can temporarily move data around to achieve results like switching values.

=====================================================
======================== Variable Naming

Lesson - Naming Variables

- Naming Variables:
  - You can name your variables however you want, as long as you're consistent throughout your code.
  - Example:
    - `name`, `n`, or `l` are all possible, but consistency is key to avoid confusion.

- Make Your Code Readable:
  - The most important rule is to make your code readable to yourself and others.
  - Avoid using vague or short names like `n` or `l` for long periods. In 6-12 months, those names won’t mean much.
  - Use descriptive names that make sense based on what the variable is storing.

- Multiple Words in Variable Names:
  - You can have multiple words in a variable name.
  - Example: `username` instead of just `name`.
  - To separate words, use an underscore: `user_name`.
  - Spaces are not allowed in variable names. For example, `user name` will give a syntax error.

- Using Numbers in Variable Names:
  - You can use numbers in your variable names, e.g., `length1`, `length2`.
  - Rule: The number cannot be at the beginning of the variable name.
    - Invalid: `1length` or `3length` (will give a syntax error).
  
- Reserved Keywords (Privileged Words):
  - Some words are reserved in Python, like function names (`print`, `input`).
  - Don’t use these reserved words as variable names. It will cause confusion and could mess up syntax highlighting in your code editor.
  - Example: Using `input` as a variable name makes it look like you're trying to redefine the `input()` function.

- Spelling Consistency:
  - Be careful with spelling: If you name a variable `name`, it must always be referenced as `name`.
  - If you accidentally misspell it (e.g., `nama` instead of `name`), it will lead to a NameError.
  - Python doesn't check spelling automatically. The error occurs because Python cannot find a variable `nama` that was defined as `name`.
  
- What to Do If You Get a NameError:
  - When you get a NameError, it means a variable name is being used incorrectly or spelled wrongly.
  - Check the line mentioned in the error message, correct the typo, and your code will work.

- Conclusion:
  - Be descriptive, use consistent naming, and avoid using reserved words.
  - Always ensure correct spelling throughout your code to avoid errors.

=====================================================
======================== Day 1 Project Band Name Generator

Lesson - Final Project: Band Name Generator

Objective:
- Build a program that generates a band name by asking the user for the city they grew up in and the name of their pet.
- Combine these inputs to create a band name.

Steps to Build the Band Name Generator:

1. Create a greeting for the program:
   - Print a welcoming message to introduce the program.
     ```python
     print("Welcome to the band name generator.")
     ```

2. Ask the user for the city they grew up in:
   - Use the `input()` function to ask the user for input.
     ```python
     city = input("Which city did you grow up in?\n")
     ```
   - The `\n` is used to create a new line after the prompt.

3. Ask the user for the name of their pet:
   - Use the `input()` function again for the pet's name.
     ```python
     pet = input("What is the name of a pet?\n")
     ```

4. Combine the city and pet name:
   - Concatenate the `city` and `pet` variables to generate the band name.
     ```python
     print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + pet)
     ```
   - This combines the city and pet name, separated by a space.

5. Ensure input is displayed on a new line:
   - The `\n` inside the `input()` function ensures that the input cursor is on a new line.
   - Modify both `input()` calls to add a newline character.

6. Full Program Example:
   ```python
   print("Welcome to the band name generator.")
   city = input("Which city did you grow up in?\n")
   pet = input("What is the name of a pet?\n")
   print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + pet)

-> Key Concepts:
    - String Concatenation: Combining strings using +.
    - Using input() to get user input.
    - \n to create a new line in the input prompt for better readability.
    - Storing user input in variables (city, pet) for later use.
